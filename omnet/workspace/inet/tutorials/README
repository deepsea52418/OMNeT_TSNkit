About INET Tutorials
====================

This repository is normally checked out as a submodule of the
INET Framework repository. In addition to containing the tutorial's
simulations themselves (NED files, ini files and all), this repository also
serves as input for the INET documentation.

See $INET/doc/src/README for more information on building the documentation.
