About INET Showcases
====================

This repository is normally checked out as a submodule of the
INET Framework repository. In addition to the showcase simulations
themselves (NED files, ini files and all), this repository also
serves as input for the INET documentation.

See $INET/doc/src/README for more information on building the documentation.
